# Garbage-Monitoring
This is a system that monitors garbage bins and informs the level of garbage collected in bins via a web page. It uses ultrasonic sensors placed over the bins to detect the garbage level and compare with the binâ€™s depth. The system will help to keep the city clean by informing the garbage level of the bins.
